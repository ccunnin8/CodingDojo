        <h1>What is Git?</h1>
        <p>
          Git is a version control system; you can think of it as a series of snapshots
          (commits) of your code base. With the creation of each snapshot you build out a whole
          application, seeing the grwoth of a full app. During this time you can make
          branches to experiment and come back to a previous snapshot you took or merge
          those experiments into your app.
        </p>
        <h1>What is GitHub?</h1>
        <p>
          GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.
          It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere using those code snapshots that you
          took during development.

          <h2>Git init</h2>
          <p>
            <span>Git init</span> is hte act of registering this current code base

        </div>
        <div class="small middle">
          <h2>Git add</h2>
          <p>
            <span>Git add</span> is how we stage the integration of our current code
            base into our current list of snapshots
          </p>

        <div class="small">
          <h2>Git status</h2>
          <p>
            <span>Git status</span> allows us to see the changes we are going to make.

        <div class="medium left">
          <h2>Git commit</h2>
          <p>
            <span>Git commit</span>; finally we can commit those changes we added to our last
            snapshot giving us a new snapshot of our code with whatever new changes were made
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="medium">
          <h2>Git remote add</h2>
          <p>
            <span>Git remote add</span> is used to set up a online repository where
            we can place all of our current code. This is where the outside world can see our code base.

        </div>
        <div class="large">
            <h2>Git push</h2>
            <p>
              <span>Git push</span> is how we get our code to GitHub, an excellent place to store all of our repositories.
              Other developers might look at our existing projects to see how we approached problems, pull down our
              code and add new features or even update our code base with features they wanted to add
